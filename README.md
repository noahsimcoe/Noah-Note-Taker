# Noah-Note-Taker
Challenge 11

## Description
I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of using Express.js. While working on this project, I proved that I was able to successfully create a full stack application with using express.js to connect to a backend. For this project we used a json file to store data (notes), and it is fully functional with a user being able to save/delete the notes that they take.

## Installation
This project is deployed on Heroku and can viewed at the link below.

## Usage
This project is used to provide the user with an application that will act as a digital journal that saves typed out notes. The user has the ability to give the notes a title and then add to them with a body of text. The user can also delete specific notes once they aren't needed anymore.
